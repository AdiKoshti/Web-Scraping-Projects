# Web-Scraping-Projects

#### This repository showcases my Web Scraping projects, demonstrating my skills in extracting and processing data from websites, web pages, and online documents. The projects cover a range of topics, including:
* Data Extraction (extracting specific data from websites)
* Web Crawling ( crawling and scraping data from multiple web pages)
* HTML and CSS Parsing ( parsing and extracting data from HTML and CSS documents)
* Handling Anti-Scraping Measures ( bypassing anti-scraping techniques and CAPTCHAs)

#### Each project includes:
* A brief description of the problem and approach
* Code in Python, using popular libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Requests
* Results, including extracted data and insights

#### My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:
* Extract and process data from websites and web pages
* Handle common web scraping challenges and obstacles
* Develop efficient and effective web scraping solutions

I hope you find my Web Scraping portfolio informative and inspiring! Explore the projects to see my approach and results.
